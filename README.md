# Haunted House

Haunted House is a port to python, (Chez) scheme and Common Lisp of
the Haunted House adventure written in Basic language in the book
"Write your own adventure programs" by Usborne.

It's a classical textual adventure with traps to avoid and treasures
to find.

## Quick start

Just run the program with the following command:

   ```
   $ python haunted.py
   ```

For the scheme port you need Chez Scheme:

   ```
   $ chez haunted.scm
   ```

For the Common Lisp port you can use SBCL:

   ```
   $ sbcl --script haunted.lisp
   ```
